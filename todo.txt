1. Right params for Social Graph Generation
2. Correct probs in standard SDA
3. Work on improved SDA
  -> we need to create rounds where alice doesnt participate, to estimate background profiles
  -> how to differentiate rounds though? time!
4. We only have symmetric social connections. Is that wanted?
-> Problem with that is that in standard SDA, ALice is also in the background recipient set
5. Does knowledge about social graph mean knowledge about the probabilities? thats how it is right now. alternative: knows recipients, but assumes uniform profile (cant do anything else right now anyways)
