# Simulator

This repository contains the Python implementation of a mix network simulator. Originally, the simulator was build to perform an empirical analysis of the anonymity offered by the Loopix anonymity system https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity17/technical-sessions/presentation/piotrowska and further extended to support more experiments.
